# Custom Index with Prefix Integration

## Overview

This example demonstrates the retrieval of custom indexes with prefix functionality from existing streams within the TRUF.NETWORK (TN) SDK framework.

> **Note:** Data provider partnership is required to integrate custom methods with prefix functionality into standard operations as shown in this implementation.

## Objectives

This implementation illustrates:
- Establishing connections to TN nodes (local or mainnet environments)
- Retrieving indexed data from predefined streams using standard methods enhanced with prefix capabilities

## Core Components

- TN client initialization and configuration
- Stream connection establishment
- Stream index retrieval operations
- Time-based index query

## System Requirements

- Go 1.20 or later
- TRUF.NETWORK SDK
- Active TN node access (local or mainnet)
- Valid stream for data retrieval operations

## Setup Instructions

Prior to execution:
1. Replace `"your-private-key"` with your authenticated private key
2. Configure the `endpoint` to match your designated TN node
3. Verify stream ID and data provider specifications

## Execution

```bash
go run .
```

## Implementation Notes

- This example utilizes a preconfigured AI Index stream
- Stream parameters should be adjusted to match specific implementation requirements
- Production environments require robust error handling mechanisms
- Prefix functionality is currently supported for `get_record` and `get_index` operations only

## Extension Possibilities

This framework can be extended to:

- Interface with multiple stream sources
- Implement custom time range parameters for index queries
- Integrate advanced data processing and analytics capabilities
